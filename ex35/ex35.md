## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
1
-1
```

### reason:

`a[0]` is `undefined`. `undefined` is the javascript primitive type
The missing array element contributes to the `length` of the `Array` and increases the `index` of subsequent elements.
Elements are not `undefined`, they are not `initialized`.

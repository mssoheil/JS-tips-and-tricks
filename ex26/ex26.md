## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
0 1 2 3 and "john" "jane" "sam" "jack"
```

### reason:

With a `for-in` loop, we can `iterate` over `enumerable` properties which in an array are the `"keys"` of array elements, which are actually their `indexes`.

With a `for-of` `loop`, we can iterate over `iterables`. so the `values` are logged.

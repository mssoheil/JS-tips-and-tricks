## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}
undefined
```

### reason:

We didn't use the `new` keyword. When using `new`, it refers to the `new` empty `object` we create. If we don't add `new` it will be the `global` object.
sarah is `undefined`, because we don't `return` a value from the `Person` function.

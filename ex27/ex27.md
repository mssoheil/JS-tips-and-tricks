## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
They are the same!
```

### reason:

`Objects` are passed `by reference`. When we check `objects` for `strict equality` we're comparing their `references`.
We set the default value for `person2` equal to the `person` object, and passed the `person` object as the value for `person1`.
This means that both values have a reference to the same spot in memory, thus they are equal.

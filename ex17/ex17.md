## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
A B
```

### reason:

`p1` is resolved not with an immediate value but with the promise `p3` which is resolved with the value `"B"` The `p3` is unwrap into `p1`, but asynchronously, so `p1` callback is behind `p2` callback in the asynchronus Job queue.

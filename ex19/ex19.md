## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
Lydia is 21 function
```

### reason:

With `call` and `bind`, we can pass the object to which we want `this` keyword to refer to. But `call` is also executed immediately. `bind` returns a copy of the function, but with a bound it's not executed immediately.

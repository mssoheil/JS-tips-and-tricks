## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
> ["42"] < ["043"] -> false
> [4,2] < [0,4,3] -> false
> {b: 42} < {b: 43} -> false
> {b: 42} <= {b: 43} -> true

```

### reason:

First calls `ToPrimitive` coercion on both values, and if the return result of
either is not a `string`, then both will be coerced to `number` and numerically will be checked
If both sides are `string` both sides will be alphabetically checked
Both `{b: 42}` and `{b:43}` will be `[object Object]`
when using `a <= b` it will compare `a > b` and then negate it `[object Object] > [object Object]` is false so
the result is true

## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
1 2 , undefined 3 , undefined 4
```

### reason:

The first argument that the `reduce` receives is the `accumulator`. The second argument is the `current value`.
If the reducer don't return anything the return value will be `undefined` and so the current value in the second and the third one will be `undefined`

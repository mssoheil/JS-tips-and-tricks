## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
```

### reason:

`arr1` and `arr2` are the same (['n','h','o','j', ['j','o','n','e','s'] ]):

Calling an array object’s `reverse()` method doesn’t only return the array in `reverse` order, also reverses the order of the array itself.

The `reverse()` method returns a reference to the array itself . As a result, `arr2` is simply a `reference` to  `arr1`. Therefore, when anything is done to `arr2` (`arr2.push(arr3)`), `arr1` will be affected as well since `arr1` and `arr2` are simply references to the same object.

Passing an array to the `push()` method of another array pushes that entire array as a single element onto the end of the array. As a result, the statement `arr2`.push(`arr3`); adds `arr3` in its entirety as a single element to the end of `arr2` (i.e., it does not concatenate the two arrays, that’s what the `concat()` method is for).

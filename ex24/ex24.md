## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
"[1x whitespace]Lydia Hallie", "Lydia Hallie"
```

### reason:

With the `padStart`, we can add `whitespace` to the beginning of a string. The value passed to this method is the total length of the `string` together with the `padding`. The string `"Lydia Hallie"` has a `length` of `12`. n`ame.padStart(13)` inserts `1` `space` at the `start` of the string.

If the argument passed to the `padStart` method is smaller than the length of the array, no padding will be added.

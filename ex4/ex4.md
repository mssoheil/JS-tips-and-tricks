## Answer:

### The result will be:

```javascript
> 18
```

### reason:

Because the base is 19 the valid characters are 0-9 and a-i (case-insensitive)
The result of `0/1` is `Infinity`
It will start from the left, the first character is i which represents 18 the next character is n which is invalid so
it ignore the rest and the result will be 18
